        How to be mentally set for football's biggest match</h4>
        <hr>
    <p>A World Cup final does not just test technical and tactical ability. Football's biggest occasion demands the right mental approach too.

    <p>“There was a parade with models before the match. I tried to isolate myself from the pressure and decided to go pitchside, in one corner. The models were parading and the music playing. I was behind one of the drums and I was enjoying the show. I was enjoying so much that I forgot Aime Jacquet's pre-match talk! They were looking for me everywhere but couldn’t find me.” </p>

       <p> Fortunately for Lionnel Charbonnier, the author of this much-recounted recollection, he was only a reserve goalkeeper for France at the 1998 FIFA World Cup™ final.</p>
        
       <p> Yet his admission about hiding from the pressure is instructive all the same. After all, the World Cup final is football’s biggest match, with hundreds of millions of pairs of eyes all fixed on one tiny speck of our planet – the small green rectangle of a football pitch.</p>

    <p>The pressure it brings can cause unlikely happenings. Look at Zinedine Zidane, a man for whom the word sangfroid might have been invented, headbutting Marco Materazzi during the 2006 final between France and Italy.</p> <br>
    <p>The above-mentioned 1998 final, meanwhile, had the case of Ronaldo and his seizure earlier that same day, and O Fenômeno has spoken openly since about the challenge of dealing with the pressure of carrying Brazil’s hopes on his then 21-year-old shoulders.</p> <br>
    <p>For the record, Charbonnier has related another memory from before that final at the Stade de France – namely of the scene in the tunnel where he saw Brazil players “almost stuck against the wall [and] looking at their feet” and France players with “their heads held high and their eyes looking ahead. We had the psychological advantage.”</p>
    <h3>Sleepless nights</h3>
    <p>One man who has experienced the unique demands of a World Cup final is Gabriel Calderon, a member of Argentina’s team who finished runners-up at Italia 90.</p>
    <p>He told FIFA+: “After winning the semi-final, I didn’t sleep well a single night until the final. I couldn’t sleep for thinking, ‘Will we win or won’t we win?’ I had five or six nights of that, with the anxiety of wondering about the final result.”</p>
    <p>As he added, “we’re used to hearing it’s another game” but that is hard to equate with the reality of “80,000 people [in the stadium] and hundreds of millions watching it wherever else”.</p>
    <h4>Coach’s role</h4>
    <p>Inside Rome's Stadio Olimpico, Calderon recalls that coach Carlos Bilardo’s team speech was unusually brief. “The talk Bilardo gave was three or four minutes – the shortest he gave us. I don’t remember the exact words. I was surprised it was so short for such an important game. But everything had been said, the players knew tactically what we had to do.”</p>
    <p>From Donachie, there is the following reflection on the role of the coach in creating the right mood. “Can the head coach give you a collective sense of purpose and a collective feeling that you have a way to win the game? That adds to a sense of inner confidence as well.”
        Coaches down the years all stress the importance of keeping players relaxed – and keeping their own nerve.</p>
    <p>According to Pierre Littbarski, speaking in Chris Evans’ book ‘How to win the World Cup’, Franz Beckenbauer’s message to his West Germany players before they took on Argentina in 1990 was simply: “Just go out and win the match.”
